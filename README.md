# Distillery

This is a bare-bones program analysis library that exposes simple interfaces to
control flow graphs and concrete analyses.

## Building

Build by making a build directory (i.e. `build/`), run `cmake` in that dir, and
then use `make` to build the desired target.

Example:

``` bash
> mkdir build && cd build
> cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Debug | Coverage | Release]
> make
> ./main
> make test                       # Makes and runs the tests.
> make coverage                   # Generate a coverage report.
> make Doxygen && make Sphinx     # Generate html documentation.
```
